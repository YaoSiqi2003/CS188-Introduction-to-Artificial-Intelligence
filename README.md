# CS188 - Introduction to Artificial Intelligence

This repository contains the projects for the course **CS188: Introduction to Artificial Intelligence**. Each project focuses on a different aspect of AI, including search algorithms, multi-agent systems, reinforcement learning, probabilistic reasoning, and machine learning.

---

## Project Overview

The repository includes five projects, each focusing on a key area of artificial intelligence:

1. **Search Algorithms**: Implement various search algorithms to guide Pacman through the maze and to find food dots.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Develop minimax and expectimax search strategies to guide Pacman through a maze with ghosts.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Design and implement reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents in dynamic environments.
4. **Probabilistic Reasoning and Particle Filtering**: Use probabilistic models and particle filters for tracking and inference tasks.
5. **Machine Learning and Neural Networks**: Build and train machine learning models, including neural networks and attention mechanism.
