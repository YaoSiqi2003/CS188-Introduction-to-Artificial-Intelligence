## Project Overview

The repository includes five projects, each focusing on a key area of artificial intelligence:

1. **Search Algorithms**: Implement various search algorithms to guide Pacman through the maze and to find food dots.
2. **Multi-Agent Systems**: Develop minimax and expectimax search strategies to guide Pacman through a maze with ghosts.
3. **Reinforcement Learning**: Design and implement reinforcement learning algorithms to train agents in dynamic environments.
4. **Probabilistic Reasoning and Particle Filtering**: Use probabilistic models and particle filters for tracking and inference tasks.
5. **Machine Learning and Neural Networks**: Build and train machine learning models, including neural networks and attention mechanism.
